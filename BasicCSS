<!--Now let's put our Cat Photo App away for a little while and learn more about styling HTML.
You may have already noticed this, but all HTML elements are essentially little rectangles.
Three important properties control the space that surrounds each HTML element: padding, border, and margin.
An element's padding controls the amount of space between the element's content and its border.
Here, we can see that the blue box and the red box are nested within the yellow box. 
Note that the red box has more padding than the blue box.
When you increase the blue box's padding, it will increase the distance (padding) between the text and the border around it.
An element's margin controls the amount of space between an element's border and surrounding elements.
Here, we can see that the blue box and the red box are nested within the yellow box. 
Note that the red box has a bigger margin than the blue box, making it appear smaller.
When you increase the blue box's margin, it will increase the distance between its border and surrounding elements.
An element's margin controls the amount of space between an element's border and surrounding elements.
If you set an element's margin to a negative value, the element will grow larger.
